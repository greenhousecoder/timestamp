# Clementine

Clementine is a stripped down build of the OrangeUI javascript framework for building dynamic, interactive web applications in the browser.

Many of the features of OrangeUI are still available in Clementine, specifically base utility methods and the ViewController hierarchy. Try it out on a project and make suggestions or report bugs [here].

For additional documentation see the [OrangeUI] Docs.

## Including Clementine

To use Clementine on your project, all you need to do is include the clementine library at the top of your root html file.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" href="clementine.js"></script>
```

Depending on the features you choose to use, Clementine is dependent on the following libraries:

* jQuery - for AJAX and DOM Selectors
